#UW Info Session App 2.0

This is a new update on original UW Info Session App.

## Intention

UW Info Session App 1.x was developed more than one and a half years ago, it is my very first fully functional iOS app. At that time I was so unprofessional on iOS development, the app works well but the internal implementation is not good.

A lot of new stuffs have been updated on iOS, like Swift, Adaptive Layout and even watchOS is comming soon.

So I want to use my current experience to rebuild this app.
